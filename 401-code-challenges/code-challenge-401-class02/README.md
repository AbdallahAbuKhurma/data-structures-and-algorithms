## Approach & Efficiency

---

1. **defined the place of the middle value (index)**

2. **for loop concept**

   *a. looped from 0 index (first value) till i reached the value before the mid index and pushed the values into the new array*

   *b. looped from after the mid value to the last index  and pushed all the values*

   *c. defined the middle index to hold the value of the element to be inserted*

3. **returned the new array**
